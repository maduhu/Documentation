## Using Kibana

How to use Kibana, its dashboards and query language for L1P tracing and debugging purposes.

Kibana is the ELK Stack (Elastic Stack) window into the Elasticsearch data. It allows you to monitory, query, visualize and create reports on Elasticsearch data. This document is a L1P Kibana User Guide that will show how to use Kibana for the most common L1P use cases. Kibana features used at L1P projects will be described and then specific use cases will be described in detail.

### Kibana Dashboards and Visualizations

Kibana allows you to create visualizations based on the Elasticsearch data. Furthermore, Kibana allows you to create dashboards based on one or more visualizations. 

Elasticsearch data is generated by the several components:
•	Logstash
•	Filebeat
•	Metricbeat
•	Heartbeat

For the data generated by the Beats family of shippers Kibana also contains out of the box Dashboards and Visualizations. These come prepackaged as part of the given Beat family shipper. After installing the given Beats family shipper its dashboards and visualizations can be imported.

#### Dashboards Import

Following are the scripts to install the Beats family shipper dashboards:

- /usr/share/filebeat/scripts/import_dashboards
- /usr/share/metricbeat/scripts/import_dashboards
- /usr/share/heartbeat/scripts/import_dashboards

In order to access the visualization and dashboards that are imported by these scripts, go to Kibana and navigate to the Visualizations or Dashboards menu options at the left hand menu.

By default, Kibana will show you logs for the last 15 min. To set the time range from the Discover Kibana page click on the area where with the “Time picker” icon on the top right corner. This will expand the “Time Range” control panel down containing three different modes to set the time range; “Quick”, “Relative” and “Absolute” as shown in screenshots below.

Search results can be set to auto refresh, so your search results and visualizations do not contain stale data. Optionally, you can manually refresh results by clicking “Refresh”. The Auto-refresh can be enabled by clicking the “Time picker” icon, clicking the “Auto-refresh” link and then set it to on and specify the refresh rate.


#### How change to which indices you are searching?

#### How to trace a L1P transaction based on its L1p-Trace-Id?

Navigate to the Kibana Discover page and enter a search criterial like:

L1p-Trace-Id=d349c18b-e4ea-4913-b2f8-0b9dcd2f2293


#### How to monitor transaction duration between l1p_components?

![alt text](./images/howToMonitorTransactionDuration.png)

A Kibana Visualization on top of the custom l1p_index was created for this purpose and can be accessed by navigating to Kibana Visualize page and selecting the “Transaction Details” link. NOTE: Once the trace id is contained at all component and services logs this table will correctly display the durations. 


#### How to save a search, how to open a saved search and how to manage saved searches?

![alt text](./images/howToSaveASearch.png)

Kibana allows you to save a search criteria. From the Kibana Discover page just hit the “Save” link on the top right hand corner just before the “Time Picker” icon to save your search.
