**Details of Instances for DFSP1, DFSP2, Central services and other supporting servers**:

Info on the [Test environment](https://github.com/LevelOneProject/Docs/tree/master/AWS/Infrastructure/Test-Env). This environment is used for new development. After build, components are deployed here for testing. This environment may be broken briefly when a new component doesn't work or when two are briefly out of sync.

Info on the [Demo environment](https://github.com/LevelOneProject/Docs/blob/master/AWS/Infrastructure/Customer-Demo-Env). This environment is for demos and additional testing. It should be more stable, but may be a few builds behind. Do not deploy to this environment until all pieces are working together.
