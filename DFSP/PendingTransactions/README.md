# Pending Transaction

See [Scenario definition](https://github.com/LevelOneProject/Docs/wiki/L1P-Scenarios#buy-goods---pending-transactions)


#### Assumptions




1. The invoice will be created in the merchant's DFSP. It will be associated with an account.
2. After the invoice is created in the merchant's DFSP, a notification with the invoice reference will be send to the primary client DFSP.
3. The client DFSP will stored the reference (full URL) to the merchant's invoice.
4. The invoice reference in the client DFSP will not be associated with any client's account; thus the client can choose the account from which he is going to pay the invoice.
5. As a consequence of the above, in case the client has accounts in more than one DFSP, he will receive the invoice notification only in his primary DFSP.
From the USSD interface he will be able to pay the invoice only from his primary DFSP.


**Note:** '**dfsp1**' is referred to as client DFSP (paying the invoice) and '**dfsp2**' as the merchant DFSP (issuing the invoice).

## IV. Get Invoice Details   ##

![](./getInvoiceDetails.png)

###  [ SPSP CLIENT PROXY / SPSP CLIENT ](https://github.com/LevelOneProject/ilp-spsp-client-rest) ###


**4.1 Get Invoice Details**

Get Invoice details will be done by using the already defined method [GET /v1/query API](https://github.com/LevelOneProject/ilp-spsp-client-rest/blob/master/README.md#get-v1query).



*Request:*



    GET http://dfsp1.spsp-clinet/invoice?invoiceUrl=http://dfsp2.spsp-server/invoice/12345


*Response:*

    200 OK

    {
      "account": "dfsp2.bob.dylan.account",
      "name":"Bob Dylan",
      "currencyCode": "USD",
      "currencySymbol": "$",
      "amount": "10.40",
      "fee":"2.4",
      "status": "unpaid",
      "invoiceInfo": "https://www.example.com/gp/your-account/order-details?ie=UTF8&orderID=111-7777777-1111111"
    }


The following changes will be introduced:

- Add the invoiceUrl as request parameter, since this API is used between DFSP-Transfer and SPSP Client component. After that the SPSP client component has to have the URL to the merchant DFSP where the invoice is stored.
- type field is removed. No need of such field, because the request is for invoice.
- Add the field 'name' - this is the name of the merchant that has issued the invoice.


###  [ SPSP SERVER ](https://github.com/LevelOneProject/ilp-spsp-server) ###

**4.2 Get Invoice Details**


Get Invoice details in SPSP server will be done by using the already defined method [GET invoice](https://github.com/LevelOneProject/ilp-spsp-server/blob/master/README.md#invoice).


*Request:*


    GET http://dfsp2.spsp-server/invoice/12345


*Response:*

    200 OK

    {
      "account": "dfsp2.bob.dylan.account",
      "name":"Bob Dylan",

      "amount": "10.40",
      "status": "unpaid",
      "invoiceInfo": "https://merchant-website.example/gp/your-account/order-details?ie=UTF8&orderID=111-7777777-1111111"
    }

The following changes will be introduced:


- type field is removed. No need of such field, because the request is for invoice.
- Add the field 'name' - this is the name of the merchant that has issued the invoice.
- Remove field paymentURL - we already have an account field



###  [ SPSP Server Backend / DFSP API ](https://github.com/LevelOneProject/dfsp-api) ###

**4.3 Get Invoice Details**

The following new method will be implemented in DFSP API. SPSP Server will call this new method to obtain information about an invoice from the 'DFSP Logic'.

*Request:*

    GET http://dfsp2.dfsp-api/invoice/12345


*Response:*

    200 OK

    {
